# Project-1---DS-Bootcamp-2022-Entering-Brazilian-Market


Eniac, a major Spanish player in the Apple products resale, is planning its expansion into Brazil. Would Magist be a good fit?


I analyzed the feasibility of Eniac's expansion into Brazil using as a reference the two main questions from the board of Directors.

--1 Would Magist be the right platform and the right partner? Would they be a good fit for our high-end tech products?
--2 Fast and reliable deliveries are key to the success of Eniac in Europe. On that regard, are Magist's orders delivered fast and on-time?

Thanks to the database provided by Magist, I was able to have a preliminatory examination of the main information points and deliver a first opinion on the matter. However, more in-depth analyses are recomendded, specifically focusing on qualitative aspects like: Magist brand, Magist ability to deal with a customer of our size, feasibility of a testing-phase, and further inquiries.

For any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
